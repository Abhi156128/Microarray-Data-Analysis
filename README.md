# Microarray-Data-Analysis
In the last decade, there has been a growing scientific interest in the analysis of DNA microarray datasets, 
which have been widely used in basic and translational cancer research. 
Since DNA microarray experiments typically generate a very large number of features for a limited number of patients, 
the classification task is very complex and typically requires the application of a feature-selection process to reduce
the complexity of the feature space and to identify a subset of distinctive features. 
Feature selection aims at building better classifier by listing significant features which also helps in reducing computational overload.
It is difficult to decide which approach to use for obtaining satisfactory results in the general case. 
Based on these considerations, the aim of the present work is to provide a large experimental comparison 
for evaluating the effect of the feature-selection process applied to different classification schemes.
The experiments provide a broad overview of the results obtainable on standard microarray datasets with different characteristics in terms of the number of features.
This project shows the implementation of a different feature selection techniques on different cancer cell datasets. 
In this project we will compare the different feature selection techniques on the basis of accuracy recorded for respective feature selection algorithm.
